Installation
===================

Before you can use socceraction, you'll need to get it installed. This guide
will guide you to a minimal installation that'll work while you walk through
the introduction.

==============

Being a Python library, socceraction requires Python.
Currently, socceraction supports Python version 3.9 -- 3.12.
Get the latest version of Python at https://www.python.org/downloads/ or with
your operating system's package manager.

You can verify that Python is installed by typing ``python`` from your shell;
you should see something like::

		Python 3.x.y
		[GCC 4.x] on linux
		Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

You can easily install the development version with:

		$ curl -OL https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/socceraction/archive/master.zip

Once you have a copy of the source, you can embed it in your own Python
package, or install it into your site-packages easily:

.. code-block:: console

	$ cd socceraction
	$ python -m pip install -e .
